Running Kotlin scripts inside Spring Boot applications is a cool thing.

But it is very tricky to make it work inside SpringBoot fatjars.

Kotlin cannot load classes from the fatjars.

Theoretically, a classloader can be configured for Kotlin scripting.

Unfortunately, this doesn't actually work because the implementation uses its own classloader.

The workaround is to unpack the jars used by the scripts.

This project contains sample code including a gradle setup that implements a minimal project with these requirements.
